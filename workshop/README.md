### Integral Part of IT Infrastructure
###### slide
  - make sure system is compliant with and controlled by IT
  - access control
  - monitoring of infra
  - monitoring of flows
  - maintain documentation (make available)
  - existing systems interactions
  - make sure it is compatible 
### Security
- data management issues
  - sync
  - latency
  - uniqueness
  - compatibility
### Iteration Topics
- There are important topics which should be continuously considered and evaluated throughout the project
   - from beginning to end
- We can call these "Iteration" topics
- The iteration topics should be discussed and evaluated by both:
  1. the implementation teams
  2. stakeholders and IT 
- Key iteration topics:
   - access: how is access to the data controlled and managed
   - governance: how is data quality being ensured and data assessed
   - user acceptance: 
   - testing
   - documentation
### Best practices
#### ETL
  - structure
  - manual
  - best practices
#### Data Science
- analysis and modeling
  - PoC
  - guidelines (manual)
- source integration (manual)
  - access requirements
### Development Operations
- dev-ops
  - tooling
- dev methodology
  - continue how we have worked so far
### Involvement
- interaction model
